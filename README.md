# Impact-of-NLP-in-Voice-Based-Accident-Reporting
<br>
In this project, we explore how NLP techniques can be leveraged to improve the process of accident reporting in car insurance applications. By integrating speech recognition and NLP algorithms, users can report accidents more intuitively, which can lead to faster processing and better customer satisfaction.
